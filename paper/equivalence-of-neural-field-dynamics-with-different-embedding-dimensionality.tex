\begin{abstract}
In neuroscience, neural field equations model interactions between neurons positioned in an "embedding"; a physical  (for instance, that of the cortical sheet) or abstract space (for instance, that of neuron celltypes) in which the dynamics are highly regular in space and time.

This work contributes to the formalization of the search for neural field models, and in particular treats the question of the embedding space uniqueness by studying its dimensionality. We show that given some neural dynamics, we can find multiple equivalent embedding spaces in different dimensions, in the sense that they have the same dynamics.

The core of this work lies in the study of bijective mappings $S$ between $[0,1]^2$ and $[0,1]$, which allows mapping a two-dimensional neural field to an equivalent one-dimensional neural field. This procedure is easily generalized to map between embeddings in arbitrary number of dimensions.

We illustrate this work through extensive numerical simulations and animations of a low-rank toy model. In particular, the coarse-graining procedure is introduced, in which numerical simulations of $2^n$ (where $n$ is an integer quantifying the resolution of the simulation grid) neural populations in a one-dimensional embedding converge to the same dynamics obtained from simulations of $2^n \times 2^n$ neural populations in a two-dimensional embedding. We additionally introduce a measure of locality, which quantifies how the regularity ("smoothness") of the neural fields is conserved through the mappings $S$. In particular, we use a subset composed of binary mappings, and borrow the Z-order curve from the computer graphics field, which we show is a "local" mapping. We finally prove that this locality guarantees that the one-dimensional neural field equations can be approximated using classical grid-based methods, and therefore the numerical simulations yield the correct equivalent dynamics.
