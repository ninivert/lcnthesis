				We have examined this issue in the context of the tuning of

				incorporates both orientation-selective input from the lateral
				geniculate nucleus and orientation-specific cortical
				interactions. Depending on the model parameters, the network
				exhibits orientation selectivity that originates from within the
				cortex, by a symmetry-breaking mechanism. In this case, the width
				of the orientation tuning can be sharp even if the lateral
				geniculate nucleus inputs are only weakly anisotropic. By using
				our model, several experimental consequences of this cortical
				mechanism of orientation tuning are derived. The tuning width is
				relatively independent of the contrast and angular anisotropy of
				the visual stimulus. The transient population response to
				changing of the stimulus orientation exhibits a slow ``virtual
				rotation.'' Neuronal cross-correlations exhibit long time tails,
				the sign of which depends on the preferred orientations of the
				cells and the stimulus orientation.",

abstract={Two-photon microscopy has enabled high-resolution imaging of neuroactivity at depth within scattering brain tissue. However, its various realizations have not overcome the tradeoffs between speed and spatiotemporal sampling that would be necessary to enable mesoscale volumetric recording of neuroactivity at cellular resolution and speed compatible with resolving calcium transients. Here, we introduce light beads microscopy (LBM), a scalable and spatiotemporally optimal acquisition approach limited only by fluorescence lifetime, where a set of axially separated and temporally distinct foci record the entire axial imaging range near-simultaneously, enabling volumetric recording at 1.41{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}108 voxels per second. Using LBM, we demonstrate mesoscopic and volumetric imaging at multiple scales in the mouse cortex, including cellular-resolution recordings within {\textasciitilde}3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}5{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}0.5{\thinspace}mm volumes containing >200,000 neurons at {\textasciitilde}5{\thinspace}Hz and recordings of populations of {\textasciitilde}1 million neurons within {\textasciitilde}5.4{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}6{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}0.5{\thinspace}mm volumes at {\textasciitilde}2{\thinspace}Hz, as well as higher speed (9.6{\thinspace}Hz) subcellular-resolution volumetric recordings. LBM provides an opportunity for discovering the neurocomputations underlying cortex-wide encoding and processing of information in the mammalian brain.},

% strange functions in real analysis

@book{kharazishvili_strange_2017,

	title = {Strange {Functions} in {Real} {Analysis}},
	isbn = {9781315154473},
	abstract = {Strange Functions in Real Analysis, Third Edition differs from the previous editions in that it includes five new chapters as well as two appendices. More importantly, the entire text has been revised and contains more detailed explanations of the presented material. In doing so, the book explores a number of important examples and constructions of pathological functions. 

After introducing basic concepts, the author begins with Cantor and Peano-type functions, then moves effortlessly to functions whose constructions require what is essentially non-effective methods. These include functions without the Baire property, functions associated with a Hamel basis of the real line and Sierpinski-Zygmund functions that are discontinuous on each subset of the real line having the cardinality continuum.

Finally, the author considers examples of functions whose existence cannot be established without the help of additional set-theoretical axioms. On the whole, the book is devoted to strange functions (and point sets) in real analysis and their applications.},

This set, which had its humble beginnings as a counterexample in an appendix has since taken on a life of its own and has served ever since its inception, as an example, counterexample, and inspiration for inquiries into the most remote recesses of mathematical analysis. It is no coincidence that it appears in a fundamental role in the study of space-filling curves. We will see in Chapter 6 that this role is even more fundamental than it would appear to be from a study of the present chapter.",
