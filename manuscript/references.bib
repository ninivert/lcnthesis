abstract={Two-photon microscopy has enabled high-resolution imaging of neuroactivity at depth within scattering brain tissue. However, its various realizations have not overcome the tradeoffs between speed and spatiotemporal sampling that would be necessary to enable mesoscale volumetric recording of neuroactivity at cellular resolution and speed compatible with resolving calcium transients. Here, we introduce light beads microscopy (LBM), a scalable and spatiotemporally optimal acquisition approach limited only by fluorescence lifetime, where a set of axially separated and temporally distinct foci record the entire axial imaging range near-simultaneously, enabling volumetric recording at 1.41{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}108 voxels per second. Using LBM, we demonstrate mesoscopic and volumetric imaging at multiple scales in the mouse cortex, including cellular-resolution recordings within {\textasciitilde}3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}5{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}0.5{\thinspace}mm volumes containing >200,000 neurons at {\textasciitilde}5{\thinspace}Hz and recordings of populations of {\textasciitilde}1 million neurons within {\textasciitilde}5.4{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}6{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}0.5{\thinspace}mm volumes at {\textasciitilde}2{\thinspace}Hz, as well as higher speed (9.6{\thinspace}Hz) subcellular-resolution volumetric recordings.

More importantly, the entire text has been revised and contains more detailed explanations of the presented material. In doing so, the book explores a number of important examples and constructions of pathological functions. 

After introducing basic concepts, the author begins with Cantor and Peano-type functions, then moves effortlessly to functions whose constructions require what is essentially non-effective methods. These include functions without the Baire property, functions associated with a Hamel basis of the real line and Sierpinski-Zygmund functions that are discontinuous on each subset of the real line having the cardinality continuum.

Finally, the author considers examples of functions whose existence cannot be established without the help of additional set-theoretical axioms. On the whole, the book is devoted to strange functions (and point sets) in real analysis and their applications.},

journal = {Network: Computation in Neural Systems},
abstract = {The Hopfield network provides a simple model of an associative memory in a neuronal structure. It is, however, based on highly artificial assumptions, especially the use of formal two-state neurons or graded-response neurons. The authors address the question of what happens if formal neurons are replaced by a model of 'spiking' neurons. They do so in two steps. First, they show how to include refractoriness and noise into a simple threshold model of neuronal spiking. The spike trains resulting from such a model reproduce the distribution of interspike intervals and gain functions found in real neurons. In a second step they connect the model neurons so as to form a large associative memory system. The spike transmission is described by a synaptic kernel which includes axonal delays, 'Hebbian' synaptic efficacies, and a realistic postsynaptic response. The collective behaviour of the system is predicted by a set of dynamical equations which are exact in the limit of a large and fully connected network that has to store a finite number of patterns. The authors show that in a stationary retrieval state the statistics of the spiking dynamics is completely wiped out and the system reduces to a network of graded-response neurons. In the case of an oscillatory retrieval state, however, the spiking noise and the internal time constants of the neurons become important and determine the behaviour of the system.}

              the connectivity structure of a network determines the emergent

              consider a novel class of models, gaussian-mixture, low-rank

              and the number of statistically defined populations are

              collective dynamics form a dynamical system, where the rank sets
              the dimensionality and the population structure shapes the
              dynamics. In particular, the collective dynamics can be described
              in terms of a simplified effective circuit of interacting latent
              variables. While having a single global population strongly
              restricts the possible dynamics, we demonstrate that if the

abstract={A neuronal population encodes information most efficiently when its stimulus responses are high-dimensional and uncorrelated, and most robustly when they are lower-dimensional and correlated. Here we analysed the dimensionality of the encoding of natural images by large populations of neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice. The evoked population activity was high-dimensional, and correlations obeyed an unexpected power law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This scaling was not inherited from the power law spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that if the variance spectrum was to decay more slowly then the population code could not be smooth, allowing small changes in input to dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness may represent a fundamental constraint that determines correlations in neural population codes.},
