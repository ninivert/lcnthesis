# A simple model for a neural field in $\mathbb R^2$

## Building up a neural field in $\mathbb R^2$

p=1 then p=2, show simulations

## Characterizing dynamics

introduce overlap, and in our case the low-rank model the kappa

overlaps as an approximation of the "dynamics" (latent space), in the case phi=linear

warning : we need absolutely to distinguish the latent and the embedding space

## A cycling neural field

why ? dynamics are more interesting

1. delayed neural field
2. rolled neural field

show what the analytical kappa is

introduce both, derive kappa again

simulate cycling in p=2
