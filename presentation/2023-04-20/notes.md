## low rank RNNs converge to neural field equations

note : more general formulation exists
- instead of gaussian, can be any pdf
- F(xi) and G(xi) can be any function

## demo p=1

phi=linear : the overlap != 1 is due to finite-N effects

sigmoid seems to converge better than linear

## demo p=2

not perfectly along one dimension due to finite-N effects

## mapping [0,1]Â² to [0,1]

with linear mappings, when the tangent is aligned with the overlap vector, we get a nice sigmoid in the image

note : we get similar results using PCA
